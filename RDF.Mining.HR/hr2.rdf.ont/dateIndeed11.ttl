Role: Java Developer  Description: Collaborative Supply Execution (CSE) is an I2 software application used for GMCC system shortfall calculations  user interface  and other key functions. GMCC provides a standardized business process and supporting system to control supplier (shared and unshared) part capacity across and within GM's Business Units (BU) and Regions and the capability to mitigate the risks inherent in few strategies by controlling supplier capacity consistently at global  business-unit  and regional levels. Global architectures and global sourcing are resulting in situations where a single supplier location will supply the same parts and components to GM plants in multiple regions. Without a global view on supplier capabilities and overall demand of shared capacities  the risk of part shortages will increase gradually.    Responsibilities:  â€˘ Gathered Requirements for the new modules added to the existing GMCC application.  â€˘ Design the new modules-Simulation  Upload Functionality with Argo UML  Microsoft Visio.  â€˘ GMCC is a web application that includes front-end written in XML and JavaScript  mid-tier components in J2EE along with database connectivity using JDBC.  â€˘ Developed java code using Eclipse Juno  XML code using i2 GM Studios and database - Sql  Stored Procedures using SQL Developer.  â€˘ Implemented MVC Architecture for the XML based UI Development to access data from the database and processing it to provide it to front end View.  â€˘ Written Test classes using JUnit 4.0  Mutation Testing and Code Coverage to help simplify mocks for JUnit Testing. Application Server used for building and deploying the enterprise application used is Weblogic 10MP2.  â€˘ Followed Agile development methodology  by having frequent client participation in form of regular scrum meetings and planning meeting once a week.  â€˘ Provide support to the team by resolving the security issues like i2GMLoginModule by altering the database connectivity.  â€˘ Documenting the progress of the software development and preparing timely estimates about the time required to finish the project.

It's based on J2EE & supports XML based data driven workflow (based on BEA Weblogic Server/Oracle).  Order Fulfilment System is a core component of BT Retail Hub. This is an application implemented as EJBs running on a Web Logic Application Server. OFS provides the ability to map from a complex front end sales order (described in terms the customer understands and comes from different interfaces like- one view  one Seibel) to a number of different back end supplier(like-20-20  Vodafone  Openreach) orders in a number of fulfilment strands  and to control the overall fulfilment of the sales order. OFS is a generic application  with different behaviour for different products driven by Proposition & Product Mapping data and rules. The PPM data is held in a series of XML files  which can be updated and then utilised by OFS without bringing down OFS.  OFS extensively uses finite state machine concept. During this process an order goes through different states depending on its fulfilment type. The decision of how a source product is fulfilled to supplier one  is taken by PMS (Product Management System). PMS makes this decision with the help of PPM (Product Proposition Mappings). PPM is a set of XML files which has the source and target product information in the form of mappings. Maintaining this data in the form of xml's makes OFS a much flexible data driven system.    Responsibility:  â€˘ Worked in Test Driven Development (TDD) by writing test cases before actual development of functional flow.  â€˘ Followed agile methodology for development.  â€˘ Developed User Interface for user stories using core java  EJB-Session bean and MDB.  â€˘ Implement generic collection in OFS application.  â€˘ Interact with Business Users to understand requirements and preparation of Technical Design Documents for the development tasks.  â€˘ Worked on local testing  fixed all issues as per functional testing and system testing.  â€˘ Preparation of Technical/Design Documents for both high and low level designs.

	JobSee:Position_held " Project: Order Fulfilment System (OFS)  Description: OFS is the application developed by BT to manage Order Fulfillment & Orchestration. It's based on J2EE & supports XML based data driven workflow (based on BEA Weblogic Server/Oracle).  Order Fulfilment System is a core component of BT Retail Hub. This is an application implemented as EJBs running on a Web Logic Application Server. OFS provides the ability to map from a complex front end sales order (described in terms the customer understands and comes from different interfaces like- one view  one Seibel) to a number of different back end supplier(like-20-20  Vodafone  Openreach) orders in a number of fulfilment strands  and to control the overall fulfilment of the sales order. OFS is a generic application  with different behaviour for different products driven by Proposition & Product Mapping data and rules. The PPM data is held in a series of XML files  which can be updated and then utilised by OFS without bringing down OFS.  OFS extensively uses finite state machine concept. During this process an order goes through different states depending on its fulfilment type. The decision of how a source product is fulfilled to supplier one  is taken by PMS (Product Management System). PMS makes this decision with the help of PPM (Product Proposition Mappings). PPM is a set of XML files which has the source and target product information in the form of mappings. Maintaining this data in the form of xml's makes OFS a much flexible data driven system.    Responsibility:  â€˘ Worked in Test Driven Development (TDD) by writing test cases before actual development of functional flow.  â€˘ Followed agile methodology for development.  â€˘ Developed User Interface for user stories using core java  EJB-Session bean and MDB.  â€˘ Implement generic collection in OFS application.  â€˘ Interact with Business Users to understand requirements and preparation of Technical Design Documents for the development tasks.  â€˘ Worked on local testing  fixed all issues as per functional testing and system testing.  â€˘ Preparation of Technical/Design Documents for both high and low level designs.

Role: Java Developer  Description: Collaborative Supply Execution (CSE) is an I2 software application used for GMCC system shortfall calculations  user interface  and other key functions. GMCC provides a standardized business process and supporting system to control supplier (shared and unshared) part capacity across and within GM's Business Units (BU) and Regions and the capability to mitigate the risks inherent in few strategies by controlling supplier capacity consistently at global  business-unit  and regional levels. Global architectures and global sourcing are resulting in situations where a single supplier location will supply the same parts and components to GM plants in multiple regions. Without a global view on supplier capabilities and overall demand of shared capacities  the risk of part shortages will increase gradually.    Responsibilities:  â€˘ Gathered Requirements for the new modules added to the existing GMCC application.  â€˘ Design the new modules-Simulation  Upload Functionality with Argo UML  Microsoft Visio.  â€˘ GMCC is a web application that includes front-end written in XML and JavaScript  mid-tier components in J2EE along with database connectivity using JDBC.  â€˘ Developed java code using Eclipse Juno  XML code using i2 GM Studios and database - Sql  Stored Procedures using SQL Developer.  â€˘ Implemented MVC Architecture for the XML based UI Development to access data from the database and processing it to provide it to front end View.  â€˘ Written Test classes using JUnit 4.0  Mutation Testing and Code Coverage to help simplify mocks for JUnit Testing. Application Server used for building and deploying the enterprise application used is Weblogic 10MP2.  â€˘ Followed Agile development methodology  by having frequent client participation in form of regular scrum meetings and planning meeting once a week.  â€˘ Provide support to the team by resolving the security issues like i2GMLoginModule by altering the database connectivity.  â€˘ Documenting the progress of the software development and preparing timely estimates about the time required to finish the project.
